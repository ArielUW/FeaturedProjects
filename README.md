To whom it may concern,
thank you for your interest in my work!

Please keep in mind that this folder is a collection of random university assignments I found scattered over my drives and repositories.

They were created under a lot of pressure, for non-commercial purposes and wihtout a proper team (I was working either alone or with only one equally busy person).

Their main purpose was for me to learn, and to show my tutors what I have, indeed, learnt something.

There may be typos and other errors, and many decisions may be sub-optimal – but I am proud of it anyway, and I've had a lot of fun doing them!
